"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,5,"I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.",0

"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,1,I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.,19

This replaces a 3 year old Nexus 5 that the battery was getting really bad.So far the speed and features of this Zenfone 2 seems as nice if not better, and the price was great.

I don't like writing long reviews so I would just say that it is a good phone and I have not regretted buying it. The dual SIM works well for me because I use to walk with two phones and that was frustrating, so now I have 2 sim cards in one phone and I am happy. Overall the phone is an excellent phone.",3

Specially the camera, I try to use the panoramic mode and the sphere mode 10 times and the camera would shutdown. After a number of times I manage to use but the picture was terrible as well strange noises on the image. It a big phone but the performance is terrible. Look great on paper but after using for a couple days I decided to return the item.Also stay away from this seller, Someone sends me a email every other day asking me to delete my terrible reviews of this product.I receive I used and I didn't like. AWFUL",2

"ASUS ZenFone 2 (ZE551ML) Unlocked Cellphone,5.5 inch 4GB RAM 32GB ROM Android 5.0 Smartphone.(Gray)",Samsung,250,3,"I like the phone but the “international” version doesn’t seem to come with a warranty. You have to manually update the phone, no “Over the Air” update, since the SKU is “CN” (check the box the phone was shipped in) but the installed software was “WW” (check “about” phone in settings). So unless you are technically adept you most likely won’t be able to update this particular configuration. My phone had outdated firmware. On the plus side the phone I received was “rooted” probably so they could install the appropriate OS for the region the phone was being sold to. I ended up returning this phone because the speaker did not work. I did buy the same phone from another vendor that claims to have a US warranty.",1
"ASUS ZenFone 2 (ZE551ML) Unlocked Cellphone,5.5 inch 4GB RAM 32GB ROM Android 5.0 Smartphone.(Gray)",Samsung,250,4," First let me begin with a specific piece of information that I think needs to be stated. I will test this phone with a SIM borrowed but I won't really be using it long term with cellular service at this time. I do want to offer an opinion on call and reception quality though so it will be tested in this way.Results... calls are clear on both ends without any issues and seems to be working fine in relation to both 3G and 4G.On to the rest of the phone done with the pro/con format:Pro:Big screen, bright and easy to see.MicroSD expansion option3000mAh batteryPretty good cameras (mostly the rear is what I care about)Lot of memoryNice colorDual SIM (not that I'm likely to use it though)Cons:Plastic (I'm used to aluminum phones)Fixed batteryLower clocked CPU @ 1.8Ghz (Quad core though)Button placement (biggest con for me)Speakers (I'm used to front facing Harman Kardon speakers)Additional thoughts:The interface is a love hate thing for most people. I really love the HTC Sense GUI and so I am used to that in my last three phones. The Asus Zen GUI is really nice and many useful Asus apps are included. The layout I was originally concerned about but turns out I could VERY easily live with it daily. I was very pleasantly shocked by how smooth and fast and intuitive things are with this phone. In the end it comes down to personal preference. (I really dislike the Samsung GUI for example but like their hardware).Price... I feel for the speed and overall look and feel and being unlocked it is a very good phone, feels a lot like a flagship model in operation also it doesn't offer all the bells and whistles some phones are currently sporting.Question:Since I am not using it like a normal cell phone why do I want it?Answer:I dislike killing my main phone's battery and want the portability of a phone but the functionality of a tablet. This phablet is the perfect compromise offering a great size and feature set.I have a drone that needs a phone to control it and portability is an important factor so this is a nice quick device that I am hoping works well to use with my drone as the remote control. Around WiFi I can surf the web and check emails and not use my main cell. Also nice to have a backup phone and I may even use this as a pay as you go option at some point so I didn't want to get into big money with a phone to find out I won't use it.So plenty of good and not so good but overall none of the cons are all that bad considering $250 beats $600+. If you can use this phone on your network then I don't think you can go wrong with it.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.",3
